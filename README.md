App uses Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users are able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users are also able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

Completing this project helped me understand:
  - Using the Redux library
  - Why and when to use Redux in a React app
  - How to use Redux as middleware logic
  - How to write tests in Redux

Created in tandem with CodeCademy Front-End Development Course. For educational purposes only.
